/*
Write a program and ask the user to enter a few words separated by a space. Use the words to create a variable name with PascalCase. 
For example, if the user types: "number of students", display "NumberOfStudents". 
Make sure that the program is not dependent on the input. So, if the user types "NUMBER OF STUDENTS", the program should still display "NumberOfStudents".
